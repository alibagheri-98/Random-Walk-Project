# Random-Walk-Project
Within this repository, you'll discover a project centered around the theme of "Random Walk." Our approach involves employing random walk methods in a real world application. The primary objective of this project is to showcase the practical applications of probability to students. Notably, we crafted and executed this project during our tenure as teaching assistants for the probability course at Sharif University of Technology. I had the privilege of leading this initiative.
